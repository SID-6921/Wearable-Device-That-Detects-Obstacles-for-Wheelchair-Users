# 🦽 Wearable Obstacle Detection Device for Wheelchair Users

This project is a prototype of a wearable device designed to help wheelchair users detect obstacles in their surroundings.

## 📁 Files Included

- `materials_step_one_list.csv` – Contains the list of materials used for the project.
- `Schematic_view.pdf` – Circuit diagram of the wearable device.
- `wearablecode.ino` – Arduino UNO-based prototype code.
- `wearablecodeAttiny44.ino` – Code adapted for Attiny44-based version.

## 📌 Overview

The device uses an ultrasonic sensor to detect nearby obstacles and alerts the user through vibration and sound. The OLED display shows distance measurements in real-time.

## 🔧 Prototyping Stages

1. Arduino UNO-based prototype
2. Attiny44 miniaturized version
3. Final integration on PCB (optional for this repo)
